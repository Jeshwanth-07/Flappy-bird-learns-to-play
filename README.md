# Flappy-bird-learns-to-play
This is an fun gameplay of a flappy bird, but there is a twist to it rather than a classic flappy bird. The bird learns to avoid the obstacles and plays by itself using AI with NEAT (Neuro Evolution Augmenting Topologies). It handles itself and learns from its mistakes and get better and better over mutations.
